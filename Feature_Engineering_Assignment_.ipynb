        "In machine learning, many algorithms require numerical input. However, real-world data often includes categorical variables, which represent distinct categories or groups (e.g., \"color\" with values like \"red,\" \"blue,\" \"green\"). Data encoding is the process of converting these categorical variables into numerical representations that can be understood and processed by machine learning algorithms.\n",
